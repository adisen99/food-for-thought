      <description>The Bohr Family   Niels Bohr was a great practitioner of the Scientific method and inspired many physicists throughout his career such as Werner Heisenberg, Lev Landau, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, just to name a few and undoubtedly continues to do so.
But his motivations and influential contributions are resonated in his own family as well. This image that I came across a few days ago, tugged at my conscience and made me realize something truly extraordinary.</description>

      <description>   I believe that small though we are, insignificant though we may be, the human mind is capable of very very big things indeed. We are capable of reaching a full understanding of our universe and then realize that all we had to do was to look within ourselves.

      <description>Lorenz Attractors   Chaos And then people say physics is not poetic and beautiful.
At first glance, this picture looks like a work of art( well technically it is art because itâ€™s a pictorial representation) but this is a graphical representation of a so-called Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations studied by E. Lorenz, the first person ever to visually see the solution of a so-called 3 -body problem as seen in this picture.</description>
