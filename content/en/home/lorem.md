I am a Physics major and I am currently awaiting my Bachelors degree results and looking for admission to a graduate school in India. 

- I have unertaken several literature review projects during my undergraduate years and 2 projects were as a Summer Trainee at **Inter University Accelerator Center (IUAC), New Delhi** in the field of Atomic Physics and it was on the study and optimization of bias voltage and gas pressure in a [Position Sensitive Proportional Counter](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/ruh/handbook/node48.html); 

- one is currently an ongoing project at **CSIR-NEIST** as a part of the Summer Research Training program at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Summer 2020. The current project is in the field of Seismology focusing on the use of [Gutenberg-Richter Relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law) for Hazard Estimation in the Andaman Region.

- My other summer projects were carried out under the guidance of my institute's Department head in the field of Space Plasma Physics and specifically in the study of [Instabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_stability) in the [Magnetosphere of Jovian planets specifically Saturn](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/magnetosphere/)

- I love learning new things. I love chess and I am a linux enthusiast. I wish to use this blog as a method to share some of the pieces of software I use daily to make my life easier and also to share some of the algorithms I use for Physics problems and more.
