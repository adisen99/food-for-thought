This is **Food 4 Thought**, the personal blog of Aditya Sengupta {adisen99}.

I am a University student in India currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Physics at Amity University, Noida. I am a football and basketball enthusiast and love watching sports. I love playing chess and listening to classical instrumental music. I am a dedicated and hardworking student and hope to be the best I can be at my field of Physics and hopefully contribute to helping make the world a better place.

This website is an exposition to the world for my ideas and thoughts on developments in physics, scientific thought and everything that I find interesting in science, technology, music, art and also a brief overview of my projects and my passion for Linux.

**Hope you like the content and feel free to share your thoughts to me directly on the various social accounts on the header**
