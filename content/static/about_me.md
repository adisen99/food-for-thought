This is **Food 4 Thought**, the personal blog of Aditya Sengupta {adisen99}.

- I am a Physics Graduate currently pursuing a Masters program at the [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](https://nitrkl.ac.in) in the field of **Atmospheric Science**. I love science and particularly Physics and I am a linux enthusiast. I love quantitative research and learning more about the world. I am an avide reader of Journals and my ambition is to work in a field that deals directly with the Climate change and how we can overcome it. I love playing chess and watching football and Basketball.

- I was recently selected for the prestigious Science Acdemies' [Summer Research Fellowship Program (SRFP) 2021](https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2021/lists/result.jsp) and I will be working under the guidance of Dr. Sachin D. Ghude at the [Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune](https://tropmet.res.in).

- I recently completed my Graduation from [Amity Institute of Applied Sciences](https://amity.edu/aias), [Amity University](https://amity.edu), Noida, Uttar Pradesh with GPA of 9.63 on a 10.0 point scale.

- I recently completed working as a Summer Research Trainee at [CSIR-NEIST](http://www.neist.res.in/) via the online [CSIR-SRTP](http://www.neist.res.in/srtp2020/) 2020 program.
