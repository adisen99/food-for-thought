I am a University student in India currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Physics at Amity University, Noida.   
I am a football and basketball enthusiast and love watching sports. I love playing chess and listening to classical instrumental music. I am a dedicated and hardworking student and hope to be the best I can be at my field of Physics and hopefully contribute to helping make the world a better place.  
This website is an exposition to the world for my ideas and thoughts on developments in physics, scientific thought and everything that I find interesting in science, technology, music, art
